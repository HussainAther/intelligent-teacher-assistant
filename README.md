## **Example Dataset**

### **Student Data (`datasets/student_data.csv`):**
| ID   | Name         | Score | Attendance | Engagement |
|------|--------------|-------|------------|------------|
| 101  | Alice Smith  | 85    | 95%        | High       |
| 102  | Bob Johnson  | 72    | 88%        | Medium     |
| 103  | Charlie Lee  | 64    | 80%        | Low        |

### **Feedback Samples (`datasets/feedback_samples.csv`):**
| ID   | Feedback                                                                 |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 101  | "Great job, Alice! Keep up the good work on your attendance and scores." |
| 102  | "Bob, you're doing well, but focus on increasing your engagement."       |
| 103  | "Charlie, let's work on improving your attendance and test scores."      |
